## Short Biography

Hello, I am Minghan Wei, an assistant professor in EECS department at FAU. I received my Ph.D. degree in Jan, 2022 from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, under the supervision of [Prof. Volkan Isler](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~isler/).

My research interests are in the general area of ***Robotics*** perception, mapping, planning, and control for practical indoor and field applications such as precision agriculture and environmental monitoring.
* One focus of my research is to study how to improve the energy efficiency of robots in these applications.
* I study how to apply learning-based methods to predict energy-cost maps so that energy-optimal paths can be planned.
* I study and design energy-aware path planning algorithms to minimize total energy consumption.
* I also implement practical robotic systems, e.g. autonomous robot mowers, for these applications.
