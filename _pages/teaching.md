I enjoyed helping students master new knowledge and skills in computer science, such as analytical thinking, mathematics, and programming.

### Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Florida Atlantic University

- **EEL 6935 / COT 6930 / COT 4930: Introduction to Intelligent Autonomous Robots** (Fall 2024)  
  - *Instructor*  
  - This course introduces foundational concepts and practical skills for building intelligent autonomous robots capable of safe and efficient navigation in the real world. Topics include camera projection models, epipolar geometry, visual odometry, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), and motion/path planning. Students apply these concepts through a hands-on robotics project, which serves as the final assessment of the course.

- **COP 3530: Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis** (Fall 2023, Fall 2024)  
  - *Instructor*  
  - This course provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs. Students learn to apply and analyze efficient algorithms for searching, sorting, with emphasis on both theoretical foundations and practical implementation.
